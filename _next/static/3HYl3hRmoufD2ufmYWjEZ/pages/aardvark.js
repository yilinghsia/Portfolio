I got a mentor assigned to me, who I met up with weekly over Skype to go through assignments with. There was a lot of material to prepare you for the ﬁnal assignment: a news website. I really enjoyed following this course because it allowed me to ask questions and discuss with another designer. In return I have a better understanding on certain topics and it was a good and much needed basics refresher.

In the course you could see what others before you made, which was mostly bright, light and very stylized designs. I wanted my design to differ from these because I wanted to experiment with a different style than my normal one. So my design for The Aardvark became a night theme with some neon accents. After the course ﬁnished I didn’t stop playing around with the design, because I feel like the design that I handed in wasn’t quite there yet. The design you see here is the latest version of The Aardvark.
