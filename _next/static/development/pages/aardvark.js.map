I got a mentor assigned to me, who I met up with weekly over Skype to go through assignments with.\n\t\t\t\tThere was a lot of material to prepare you for the ﬁnal assignment: a news website. I really enjoyed following this course because it allowed me to ask questions and discuss with another designer. In return I have a better understanding on certain topics and it was a good and much needed basics refresher.\n\t\t\t\tYou can see this project <a target=\"_window\" href=\"https://trydesignlab.com/certificates/ui-design/YiLing/\">here</a>.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<div className=\"project-challenge\">\n\t\t\t<h2>The challenge</h2>\n\t\t\t<div className=\"project-screens\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring this course I had a bit of a hard time trying to determine the look for The Aardvark since there were really no requirements. In the course you could see what others before you made, which was mostly bright, light and very stylized designs. I wanted my design to differ from these because I wanted to experiment with a different style than my normal one. So my design for The Aardvark became a night theme with some neon accents. \n\t\t\t\t\tAfter the course ﬁnished I didn’t stop playing around with the design, because I feel like the design that I handed in wasn’t quite there yet. The design you see here is the latest version of The Aardvark. I tweaked a bit of the color and fonts so that gives it a smoother look compared to the one I submitted back then.\n\t\t\t \t</p> \n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/static/images/aardvark-moodboard.png\" alt=\"moodboard\"/>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div className=\"styleguide\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/static/images/mockup-aardvark.png\"  alt=\"mockup aardvark\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/static/images/aardvark-styleguide.png\"  alt=\"styleguide aardvark\"/>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<img className=\"full-design\" src=\"/static/images/aardvark.png\" alt=\"full screen aardvark\"/>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t)","module.exports = dll_ecba6b44147cc8018369;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;AAAA;;;;;;;;;;;ACAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ACvBA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA3BA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ACAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
